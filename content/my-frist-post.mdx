Welcome, to anyone who cares to read. I decided to create these blog pieces as a way to share some of my past experiences, tech stacks I like, and general topics that come to mind. Although, im starting out as a very small fish in a very big tech ocean, I want to convey my learnings and hopefully build some useful things in the hopes of helping others in the future.
